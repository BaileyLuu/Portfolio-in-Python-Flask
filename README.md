# What I learnt

- To link the CSS file to HTML file, I need to use url_for() function is used to build a URL to the specific function dynamically. Syntax is url_for('static', filename('css_file_Name'). CSS file is inside static folder. 
- To link the image, I need to use url_for() which is the same as when I link CSS file. Image must be put inside static folder
